# kmdo pkg completion zsh

Generate the autocompletion script for zsh

## 概要

Generate the autocompletion script for the zsh shell.

If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment you will need
to enable it.  You can execute the following once:
```zsh
	echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc
```

To load completions in your current shell session:

```zsh
	source <(kmdo pkg completion zsh)
```

To load completions for every new session, execute once:

### Linux:
```zsh
	kmdo pkg completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_goreleaser"
```
### macOS:
```zsh
	kmdo pkg completion zsh > $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_goreleaser
```
You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.


```
kmdo pkg completion zsh [flags]
```
