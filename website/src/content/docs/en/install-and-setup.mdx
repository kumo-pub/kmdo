kmdo is an automated release engineering tool developed in Go. It supports both `kminstaller` interactive 
installation and local index installation methods.  
It is compatible with Unix-like systems such as `Linux (amd64/arm64/arm-v7/i386)` and `macOS (amd64/arm64)`.
 The installation process requires no compilation and completes in seconds.

## I. Method 1: KM Installer Interactive Installation (Recommended, zero-configuration start-up)

Fully automated deployment is achieved through the official dedicated installation tool kminstaller, 
which automatically adapts to the system architecture, selects the optimal version, and configures
environment variables, making it suitable for most users to use quickly.

### Pre-dependency checks

kmdo installation only requires a Python 3.8+ environment (for running kminstaller). First, verify 
your local Python version:

```bash
# Output example: Python 3.10.12 (version ≥ 3.8 is acceptable;

# If not installed, you need to execute: sudo apt install python3-pip -y first)
```


### 2. Install the kminstaller tool

```bash
pip install kminstaller --user
# Note: The --user parameter indicates user-level installation, which does not 
# require root privileges and avoids polluting the system environment.
```
:::tip [Solving the "kminstaller: command not found" problem]

If executing `kminstaller --help` results in a command not found error, it's because the Python 
user-level binary directory is not loaded. Execute the following command:

```bash source ~/.bashrc

```
Verification: If executing `kminstaller --help` displays help information, the configuration is successful.

:::

### 4. Start the kmdo interactive installation

```bash
  kminstaller install kmdo
```

### 5. Follow the guide to complete the installation (fully visual, no manual intervention required)

#### Step 1: Automatically download the official version index

The tool will automatically download the kmdo version index file from the official source, 
which contains information on all available versions:
```bash
🔗 No local index provided, downloading official index...
✅ Official index downloaded to temporary directory
```

#### Step 2: Select kmdo Version

The terminal will list all available versions (including version number, release status, and release date). 
Use the **arrow keys** to navigate up and down, and **press Enter** to confirm your selection.
```bash
📋 Select kmdo Version
Choose a version for kmdo
  v0.6.20 (released) - Published: 2025-11-21
  v0.6.19 (released) - Published: 2025-11-20
  v0.6.18 (beta) - Published: 2025-11-19
> v0.6.17 (released) - Published: 2025-11-18
# Note: "released" refers to the stable version, and "beta" refers to 
# the test version. We recommend choosing the latest stable version.
```

#### Step 3: Automatic System Architecture Matching

The tool will detect the current system's OS and architecture, and automatically 
match the optimal binary installation package:
```bash
💻 Detected System: linux | Arch: amd64
🎯 Matched asset (score: 3): kmdo-0.6.20-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
# Supports architecture synonym adaptation: amd64 ↔ x86_64, arm64 ↔ aarch64, arm-v7 ↔ armv7l, 386 ↔ i386
```

#### Step 4: Automated Download, Decompression, and Deployment

The tool will perform the following operations without manual intervention:

1. Download the matching binary package to a temporary directory (e.g., /tmp/kmdo_install_xxx/)

2. Decompress the .tar.gz package to a temporary extraction directory

3. Copy the core program and configuration files to the default installation path

4. Add executable permissions (0755) to the kmdo binary file

5. Automatically execute `kmdo env init -f` to complete environment initialization

#### Step 5: Installation Success Message

After installation, the terminal will output the following information:
```bash
🎉 kmdo installation completed successfully!
   Install directory: /home/jeff/.kmdo
   Binary path: /home/jeff/.kmdo/kmdo
   Environment variable has been added to ~/.bashrc
💡 Tip: Run "source ~/.bashrc" to take effect immediately
```
## II. Method 2: Local Index Installation (Suitable for Offline/Internal Environments)

If your environment cannot access the external network (offline environment), or you need 
to use an internally customized version index, you can install via a local index file. The steps are as follows:

### 1. Prepare the local version index file

Obtain the kmdo_release_index.json (version index file) from official channels or the internal repository, and save
it to any local directory. Example:

:::note
- Example save path: ~/downloads/kmdo_release_index.json

- The index file contains information on all available versions (version number, release date, binary download link, etc.)
:::

### 2. Execute the local index installation command

```bash
kminstaller install kmdo --index ~/downloads/kmdo_release_index.json
# Note: The --index parameter is followed by the absolute or relative path to the local index file.
```

### 3. Installation Complete

- The tool will read the local index file and list all available versions.

- Subsequent steps are the same as interactive installation (select version → automatic download/deployment → 
  environment initialization)

- Environment variables will be automatically written to `~/.bashrc`, no manual configuration is required.

## III. Verifying the Installation

After installation, you must execute the following command to verify successful deployment:

### 1. Loading Environment Variables

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
# Note: Environment variables have been automatically written to ~/.bashrc. Executing this command
# will take effect immediately without restarting the terminal.
```

### 2. Verify kmdo version

```bash
kmdo --version
# Example of successful output (consistent with the selected version):
   _   _ _        _______      ____     
  | | /   \      /   __  \    / __ \    
  | |/ /|  \    /   |   \ \  / /  \ \   
  |   / |   \  / /| |    | DO (    ) )  
  | |\ \| |\ \/ / | |__ / /  \_\__/ /   
  |_| \_|_| \__/  |_____/     \____/

:::

## IV. Installation Details

### 1. Default Installation Path (User-level Deployment, No Root Dependency)

- Core Program: `~/.kmdo/bin/kmdo` (Main executable file)

- Configuration Directory: `~/.kmdo/config/` (Stores default configuration and baseline data)

- Cache Directory: `~/.kmdo/cache/` (Stores dependency cache and temporary files)

- Installation Log: `~/.kmdo/installer.log` (Records installation process details for troubleshooting)

### 2. Environment Variable Configuration Instructions


`kminstaller` will automatically add the following configuration to `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
# kmdo environment variable configuration (auto-generated, do not modify manually)
export KMDO_HOME="/home/jeff/.kmdo"
# Source env file only if it exists (avoid startup errors)
[ -f "$KMDO_HOME/kmdo.env" ] && source "$KMDO_HOME/kmdo.env"
```

Function: Adds the `kmdo` installation directory to the system's `KMDO_HOME` for global access.

If using the `Zsh` terminal, you need to manually add the above configuration to `~/.zshrc` and then execute 
`source ~/.zshrc`.

`$KMDO_HOME/kmdo.env` exports variables managed by `kmdo` and command auto-completion.

`$KMDO_HOME/kmdo.env` automatically loads command prompts based on the different `shells`. The command prompt 
file is located in `$KMDO_HOME/completions`.

### 3. Supported Systems and Architectures

- Operating Systems: Linux(Ubuntu/Debian/CentOS, etc.), macOS(10.15+)

- Architecture Support: amd64(x86_64), arm64(aarch64), arm-v7(armv7l), i386(386)

## V. Uninstallation Methods

kmdo uses isolated deployment; simply deleting the installation directory will completely uninstall it, 
leaving no system remnants:

### 1. Basic Uninstallation (Delete Core Files)

```bash
rm -rf ~/.kmdo
```

Note: This command will delete all kmdo-related files (programs, configurations, caches, logs).

### 2. Clean Environment Variables (Optional)
Edit the `~/.bashrc` file and remove the automatically added PATH configuration line:

```bash
# 1. Open the .bashrc file
nano ~/.bashrc
# 2. Find and delete the following lines


# kmdo environment variable configuration (auto-generated, do not modify manually)
export KMDO_HOME="/home/jeff/.kmdo"
# Source env file only if it exists (avoid startup errors)
[ -f "$KMDO_HOME/kmdo.env" ] && source "$KMDO_HOME/kmdo.env"

# 3. Save and exit: Ctrl+O → Enter → Ctrl+X
# 4. Apply the configuration: source ~/.bashrc
```

### 3. 验证卸载

```bash
kmdo --version
The message "kmdo: command not found" indicates successful uninstallation.
```

## VI. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. Download Timeout/Failure

- Symptom: During installation, the message "Download failed (Request error): HTTPSConnectionPool read timed out" appears.
- Cause: Unstable network connection or restricted GitHub access.
- Solution:
  1. Check network connection and retry the installation command.
  2. Configure a proxy: `export HTTPS_PROXY=https://proxy_address:port`, then execute the installation.
  3. Switch to Method 2 (local index installation), manually download the binary package, and then deploy.

### 2. Decompression Failure

- Symptom: "Extraction failed: tarfile.ReadError: invalid header"
- Cause: Incomplete or corrupted binary package download
- Solution:
  1. Re-execute the installation command; the tool will automatically re-download.
  2. Manually download the corresponding version of the binary package and install using method 2 (--local parameter).

### 3. Initialization Failure

- Symptom: The message "kmdo init -f failed: ..." appears.
- Cause: Permission issues or configuration conflicts occurred during environment initialization.
- Solution:
  1. Manually execute the initialization command: `kmdo env init -f`
  2. Check the error log: `cat ~/.kmdo/installer.log` to locate the specific problem.

### 4. Version Index Loading Failed

- Symptom: "Local index file not found" or "Invalid index file format" message displayed.
- Cause: Incorrect local index file path or corrupted file.
- Solution:
  1. Check if the index file path is correct (absolute path takes precedence).
  2. Re-download the index file, ensuring the file format is valid JSON.

## VII. Advanced Use (Optional)

### 1. Custom Installation Path

To install kmdo to a custom directory (e.g., /opt/kmdo), you need to modify the kminstaller configuration 
(suitable for advanced users):

```text
# 1. Locate the kminstaller installation directory (execute `pip show kminstaller | grep Location`)
# 2. Edit the `kminstaller/component/kmdo/installer.py` file
# 3. Modify the default value of `install_dir`: `install_dir = "/opt/kmdo"` (root privileges required)
# 4. Execute the installation command: `sudo kminstaller install kmdo`
```

### 2. Offline Installation (No Network Environment)

1. Download from an external network environment:

- kminstaller installation package: `pip download kminstaller --no-deps -d ~/downloads/`
- kmdo version index file: `kmdo_release_index.json`
- Target version binary package: `kmdo-version-sys-arch.tar.gz` (Choose the architecture supported by your system based on sys and arch)

2. Copy to the offline environment and execute:
```bash

# Install kminstaller

pip install ~/downloads/kminstaller-xxx.whl --user

# Install kmdo (specify local package)

kminstaller install kmdo --index ~/downloads/kmdo_release_index.json --local ~/downloads/kmdo-xxx.tar.gz

```
