Kumo has pioneered a new backend architecture called the **Islands Architecture**. Its
core idea is to make each component of the search system as independent as possible. Each component
can run as a standalone service while also collaborating through common low-level interfaces. Communication 
standards include SQL, HTTP, and Protobuf, allowing components to be flexibly plugged in and combined. 
A Kumo cluster can be deployed independently as a complete search system or integrated as a module within 
existing services, enabling unified management of componentized services.


## A brief history
Initially, in the process of supporting large-scale backend businesses, we encountered a series of challenges: 
intricate dependencies between services, where changes required modifications to multiple associated services; 
stringent platform adaptation constraints, leading to high deployment costs across different environments; 
prolonged iteration cycles due to lengthy coordination and testing processes; and frequent repetitive development,
making it difficult to reuse core capabilities.


To address these issues, we launched explorations into componentization and unified management. In early 
attempts, the team stripped away multi-layered framework dependencies from business logic, aiming to simplify 
hierarchies and stabilize core interfaces. However, due to insufficient understanding of business scenarios and
underlying systems, coupled with a lack of mature dependency governance experience, several attempts failed to
meet expectations.


Subsequently, we conducted systematic reviews of the problems arising from each attempt, sorting out issues in
interface design, dependency splitting, adaptation and compatibility, and gradually accumulated experience ranging
from top-level interface abstraction to fine-grained dependency management. Meanwhile, we clarified key prerequisites:
 the system architecture must be highly abstract to adapt to diverse business scenarios, a comprehensive grasp of
 service workflows and interaction logic is essential, and precise control over core details is required.
This series of continuous practices ultimately precipitated core features such as componentized splitting, 
localized function isolation, and selective module activation, laying a solid foundation for the subsequent 
design and implementation of the `Island Architecture.`
