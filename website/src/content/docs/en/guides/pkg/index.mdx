Kmdo can be customized by tweaking a `.kmdopkg.yaml`[^kmdopkg-yaml] file.

You can generate an example config by running
[`kmpkg init`](/en/ref/pkg/pkg_init/) or start from scratch.

You can also check if your config is valid by running
[`kmpkg check`](/en/ref/pkg/pkg_check/), which will tell you if are
using deprecated or invalid options.

## JSON Schema

Kmdo also has a [jsonschema][] file, which you can use to have better
editor support.


    ```sh
    https://pub.kumose.cc/static/kmdopkg/schema.json
    ```

    You can also specify it in your `.kmdopkg.yml` config file by adding a
    comment like the following:
    ```yaml
    # yaml-language-server: $schema=https://pub.kumose.cc/static/kmdopkg/schema.json
    ```

You can also generate it for your specific version using the
[`kmdo pkg jsonschema`][schema] command.

### Pin the schema version

You can pin the version by getting the schema from the GitHub tag, for example,
for `__VERSION__` (latest):


    ```sh
    https://pub.kumose.cc/static/kmdopkg/__VERSION__/schema.json
    ```

- While most of the documentation refers to the `.kmdopkg.yaml` filename
    for simplicity, a few different variants of it are actually accepted.
    In order of precedence:

    - `.config/kmdopkg.yml`
    - `.config/kmdopkg.yaml`
    - `.kmdopkg.yml`
    - `.kmdopkg.yaml`
    - `kmdopkg.yml`
    - `kmdopkg.yaml`

- jsonschema resource:
    - [`jsonschema`](http://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-validation.html)
    - [`schema`](/en/ref/pkg/pkg_jsonschema/)
