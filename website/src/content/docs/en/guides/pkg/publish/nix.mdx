After releasing to GitHub, GitLab, or Gitea, kmdo can generate and publish
a _nix derivation_ to an existing [Nix User Repository][nur].

## Nix User Repositories


The `nix` section specifies how the pkgs should be created:

```yaml title=".kmdopkg.yaml"
nix:
  - #
    # Name of the recipe
    #
    # Default: the project name.
    # Templates: allowed.
    name: myproject

    # IDs of the archives to use.
    # Empty means all IDs.
    ids:
      - foo
      - bar

    # GOAMD64 to specify which amd64 version to use if there are multiple
    # versions from the build section.
    #
    # Default: v1.
    goamd64: v1

    # URL which is determined by the given Token (github, gitlab or gitea).
    #
    # Default depends on the client.
    # Templates: allowed.
    url_template: "https://github.mycompany.com/foo/bar/releases/download/{{ .Tag }}/{{ .ArtifactName }}"

    # The project name and current git tag are used in the format string.
    #
    # Templates: allowed.
    commit_msg_template: "{{ .ProjectName }}: {{ .Tag }}"

    # Path for the file inside the repository.
    #
    # Default: pkgs/<name>/default.nix.
    # Templates: allowed.
    path: pkgs/foo.nix

    # Your app's homepage.
    #
    # Templates: allowed.
    # Default: inferred from global metadata.
    homepage: "https://example.com/"

    # Your app's description.
    #
    # Templates: allowed.
    # Default: inferred from global metadata.
    description: "Software to create fast and easy drum rolls."

    # License name.
    #
    # Default: inferred from global metadata.
    license: "mit"

    # Setting this will prevent kmdo to actually try to commit the updated
    # package - instead, it will be stored on the dist directory only,
    # leaving the responsibility of publishing it to the user.
    #
    # If set to auto, the release will not be uploaded to the repository
    # in case there is an indicator for prerelease in the tag e.g. v1.0.0-rc1
    #
    # Templates: allowed.
    skip_upload: true

    # Runtime dependencies of the package.
    dependencies:
    - zsh
    - chromium
    - name: bash
      os: linux
    - name: fish
      os: darwin

    # Custom install script.
    #
    # Default: 'mkdir -p $out/bin; cp -vr $binary $out/bin/$binary', and
    #   `makeWrapper` if `dependencies` were provided.
    # Templates: allowed.
    install: |
      mkdir -p $out/bin
      cp -vr ./foo $out/bin/foo

    # Custom additional install instructions.
    # This has the advantage of preventing you to rewrite the `install` script
    # if the defaults work for you.
    #
    # Templates: allowed.
    extra_install: |
      installManPage ./manpages/foo.1.gz

    # Custom post_install script.
    # Could be used to do any additional work after the "install" script
    #
    # Templates: allowed.
    post_install: |
      installShellCompletion ./completions/*

    # Repository to push the generated files to.

      # Repository owner.

      # Templates: allowed.

      # Optionally a branch can be provided.
      #
      # Default: default repository branch.
      # Templates: allowed.
      branch: main

      # Optionally a token can be provided, if it differs from the token
      # provided to GoReleaser
      #
      # Templates: allowed.
      token: "{{ .Env.GITHUB_PERSONAL_AUTH_TOKEN }}"

      # Optionally specify if this is a token from another SCM, allowing to
      # cross-publish.
      #
      # Only taken into account if `token` is set.
      #
      # Valid options:

### Things not supported

- Generating packages that compile from source (using `buildGoModule`)
- Generating packages when `archives.format` is `binary`

### Dependencies

#### `nix-hash`

The `nix-hash` binary must be available in the `$PATH` for the
publishing to work.


#### GitHub Actions

To publish a package from one repository to another using GitHub Actions, you
cannot use the default action token.
You must use a separate token with content write privileges for the tap
repository.
You can check the
[resource not accessible by integration](../errors/resource-not-accessible-by-integration.md)
for more information.

### Setting up a NUR

To set up a Nix User Repository, follow the instructions in their
[repository][nur].

Then, you'll need to:

- publish a release with kmdo: it should create the package at
  `./pkgs/{name}/default.nix` or whatever path you set it up to
- make sure `./flake.nix` is correct with what you want, especially the
  `systems` bit
- add your package to `./default.nix`
- edit your `README.md` removing the template stuff

That's it!

[nur]: https://github.com/nix-community/NUR


### Pull Requests

kmdo allows you to, instead of pushing directly to the main branch, push
to a feature branch, and open a pull requests with the changes.

#### Templates

kmdo will check for a `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, and set it in
the pull request body if it exists.

We do that to prevent extra work for maintainers of things like `winget-pkgs`,
`nixpkgs`, and so on.

#### Cross-repository pull requests

You can also push to a fork, and open the pull request in the original branch.

Here's an example on how to set it up:

```yaml title=".kmdopkg.yaml"
# ...
something: # can be nix, brews, etc...
  - repository:
      owner: john
      name: repo
      branch: "{{.ProjectName}}-{{.Version}}"
      pull_request:
        enabled: true
        base:
          owner: mike
          name: repo
          branch: main
```

This will:

- Try to sync the `john/repo` fork with `mike/repo:main` (if on GitHub).
- Create the files into `john/repo`, in the branch `foo-1.2.3` (assuming
  `ProjectName=foo` and `Version=1.2.3`). [^head]
- Open a pull request from `john/repo` into `mike/repo`, with the branch `main`
  as target. [^base]

[^head]: In GitHub's terms, this means `head=john:repo:foo-1.2.3`

[^base]: In GitHub's terms, this means `base=mike:repo:main`

#### Things that don't work

- Opening pull requests to a forked repository (`go-github` does not have the
  required fields to do it).
- Since this can fail for a myriad of reasons, if an error happen, it'll log it
  to the release output, but will not fail the pipeline.
