## Options

If you're using GitHub Actions and want to attest your build artifacts, you can
do add the following to your release workflow:

```yaml title=".github/workflows/release.yml"
# ...
permissions:
  # ...
  # Give the workflow permission to write attestations.
  id-token: write
  attestations: write

jobs:
  release:
    # ...
    steps:
      # ...
      - uses: kumose/kmdo-action@v6
        with:
          # ...
      # After kmdo runs, attest all the files in ./dist/checksums.txt:
      - uses: actions/attest-build-provenance@v3
        with:
          subject-checksums: ./dist/checksums.txt
      # After kmdo runs, attest all the images in ./dist/digests.txt:
      - uses: actions/attest-build-provenance@v3
        if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/v') # snapshots won't push docker images
        with:
          subject-checksums: ./dist/digests.txt
```

You will also want to adjust your kmdo configuration to produce the
checksum file at a predictable filename matching the release workflow.

```yaml title=".kmdopkg.yaml"
# Change the checksum filename:
checksum:
  name_template: "checksums.txt"

# Change the digests filename:
docker_digest:
  name_template: "digests.txt"
```

Users can then verify it with:

```bash
gh attestation verify --owner <user-or-org> <filename>
gh attestation verify --owner <user-or-org> <image>
```

Refer to [this repository](https://github.com/kumose/example-supply-chain)
for an example, as well as signing, SBOMs, and more.

Also make sure to read the documentation for [checksums](/en/guides/pkg/archives/checksum) and
[Docker digests](/en/guides/pkg/sign/docker_digests).
