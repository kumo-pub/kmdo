kmdo can create a GitHub/GitLab/Gitea release with the current tag, upload
all the artifacts and generate the changelog based on the new commits since the
previous tag.

## GitHub

Let's see what can be customized in the `release` section for GitHub:

```yaml title=".kmdopkg.yaml"
release:
  # Repo in which the release will be created.
  # Default: extracted from the origin remote URL or empty if its private hosted.
  github:
    owner: user
    name: repo

  # IDs of the archives to use.
  # Empty means all IDs.
  #
  # Default: [].
  ids:
    - foo
    - bar

  # If set to true, will not auto-publish the release.
  # Note: all GitHub releases start as drafts while artifacts are uploaded.
  # Available only for GitHub and Gitea.
  draft: true

  # Whether to remove existing draft releases with the same name before creating
  # a new one.
  #
  # Only effective if `draft` is set to true.
  # Available only for GitHub.
  replace_existing_draft: true

  # Whether to use an existing draft release as the target release.
  #
  # Available only for GitHub.
  # <!-- md:inline_version v2.5 -->.
  use_existing_draft: true

  # Whether to remove an artifact that already exists.
  #
  # Available only for GitHub.
  # This might be a bit expensive (rate-limiting speaking), so it is only done
  # when the upload of an artifact fails with a 422 (which means it already
  # exists in the release).
  # We then grab the list of artifacts from the release, and delete the file
  # that matches the one we're trying to upload.
  # kmdo will then retry its upload.
  replace_existing_artifacts: true

  # Useful if you want to delay the creation of the tag in the remote.
  # You can create the tag locally, but not push it, and run kmdo.
  # It'll then set the `target_commitish` portion of the GitHub release to the
  # value of this field.
  # Only works on GitHub.
  #
  # Default: ''.
  # Templates: allowed.
  target_commitish: "{{ .Commit }}"

  # This allows to change which tag GitHub will create.
  # Usually you'll use this together with `target_commitish`, or if you want to
  # publish a binary from a monorepo into a public repository somewhere, without
  # the tag prefix.
  #
  # Note: if you change this, you might want to change 'url_template' in the
  # subsequent publishers and announcers.
  #
  # This feature is only available in kmdo Pro.
  # Default: '{{ .PrefixedCurrentTag }}'.
  # Templates: allowed.
  tag: "{{ .CurrentTag }}"

  # If set, will create a release discussion in the category specified.
  #
  # Default: ''.
  discussion_category_name: General

  # If set to auto, will mark the release as not ready for production
  # in case there is an indicator for this in the tag e.g. v1.0.0-rc1
  # If set to true, will mark the release as not ready for production.
  # Default: false.
  prerelease: auto

  # If set to false, will NOT mark the release as "latest".
  # This prevents it from being shown at the top of the release list,
  # and from being returned when calling https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/releases/latest.
  #
  # Available only for GitHub.
  #
  # Default: true.
  # Templates: allowed. (Since v2.6)
  make_latest: true

  # What to do with the release notes in case the release already exists.
  #
  # Valid options are:
  # - `keep-existing`: keep the existing notes
  # - `append`: append the current release notes to the existing notes
  # - `prepend`: prepend the current release notes to the existing notes
  # - `replace`: replace existing notes
  #
  # Default: `keep-existing`.
  mode: append

  # Header for the release body.
  #
  # Templates: allowed.
  header: |
    ## Some title ({{ .Date }})

    Welcome to this new release!

  # Footer for the release body.
  #
  # Templates: allowed.
  footer: |
    ## Thanks

    Those were the changes on {{ .Tag }}!

  # You can change the name of the release.
  #
  # Default: '{{.Tag}}' ('{{.PrefixedTag}}' on Pro).
  # Templates: allowed.
  name_template: "{{.ProjectName}}-v{{.Version}} {{.Env.USER}}"

  # You can disable this pipe in order to not create the release on any SCM.
  # Keep in mind that this might also break things that depend on the release
  # URL, for instance, homebrew taps.
  #
  # Templates: allowed.
  disable: true

  # Set this to true if you want to disable just the artifact upload to the SCM.
  # If this is true, kmdo will still create the release with the
  # changelog, but won't upload anything to it.
  #
  # Templates: allowed.
  skip_upload: true

  # You can add extra pre-existing files to the release.
  # The filename on the release will be the last part of the path (base).
  # If another file with the same name exists, the last one found will be used.
  #
  # Templates: allowed.
  extra_files:
    - glob: ./path/to/file.txt
    - glob: ./glob/**/to/**/file/**/*
    - glob: ./glob/foo/to/bar/file/foobar/override_from_previous
    - glob: ./single_file.txt
      name_template: file.txt # note that this only works if glob matches 1 file only


  # Upload metadata.json and artifacts.json to the release as well.
  include_meta: true
