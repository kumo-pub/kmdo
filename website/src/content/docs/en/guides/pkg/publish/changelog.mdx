## Options

You can customize how the changelog is generated using the `changelog` section in the config file:


```yaml title=".kmdopkg.yaml"
changelog:
  # Set this to true if you don't want any changelog at all.
  #
  # Warning: this will also ignore any changelog files passed via `--release-notes`,
  # and will render an empty changelog.
  #
  # This may result in an empty release notes on GitHub/GitLab/Gitea.
  #
  # Templates: allowed.
  disable: "{{ .Env.CREATE_CHANGELOG }}"

  # Changelog generation implementation to use.
  #
  # Valid options are:
  # - `git`: uses `git log`;
  # - `github`: uses the compare GitHub API, appending the author username to the changelog.
  # - `gitlab`: uses the compare GitLab API, appending the author name and email to the changelog (requires a personal access token).
  # - `gitea`: uses the compare Gitea API, appending the author username to the changelog.
  # - `github-native`: uses the GitHub release notes generation API, disables groups, sort, and any further formatting features.
  #
  # Default: 'git'.
  use: github

  # Format to use for commit formatting.
  #
  # Templates: allowed.
  #
  # Default:
  #    if 'git': '{{ .SHA }} {{ .Message }}'
  #   otherwise: '{{ .SHA }}: {{ .Message }} ({{ with .AuthorUsername }}@{{ . }}{{ else }}{{ .AuthorName }} <{{ .AuthorEmail }}>{{ end }})'.
  #
  # Extra template fields:
  # - `SHA`: the commit SHA1
  # - `Message`: the first line of the commit message, otherwise known as commit subject
  # - `AuthorName`: the author full name (considers mailmap if 'git')
  # - `AuthorEmail`: the author email (considers mailmap if 'git')
  # - `AuthorUsername`: github/gitlab/gitea username - not available if 'git'
  #
  # Usage with 'git': <!-- md:inline_version v2.8 -->.
  format: "{{.SHA}}: {{.Message}} (@{{.AuthorUsername}})"

  # Sorts the changelog by the commit's messages.
  # Could either be asc, desc or empty
  # Empty means 'no sorting', it'll use the output of `git log` as is.
  #
  # Disabled when using 'github-native'.
  sort: asc

  # Max commit hash length to use in the changelog.
  #
  # 0: use whatever the changelog implementation gives you
  # -1: remove the commit hash from the changelog
  # any other number: max length.
  #
  # Disabled when using 'github-native'.
  abbrev: -1

  # See below for more details.

  # Group commits messages by given regex and title.
  # Order value defines the order of the groups.
  # Providing no regex means all commits will be grouped under the default group.
  #
  # Matches are performed against the first line of the commit message only,
  # prefixed with the commit SHA1, usually in the form of
  # `<abbrev-commit>[:] <title-commit>`.
  # Regex use RE2 syntax as defined here: https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax.
  #
  # Disabled when using 'github-native'.
  groups:
    - title: Features
      regexp: '^.*?feat(\([[:word:]]+\))??!?:.+$'
      order: 0
    - title: "Bug fixes"
      regexp: '^.*?bug(\([[:word:]]+\))??!?:.+$'
      order: 1
    - title: Others
      order: 999


  # Further filter changelog entries.
  #
  # Disabled when using 'github-native'.
  filters:
    # Commit messages matching the regexp listed here will be removed from
    # the changelog
    #
    # Matches are performed against the first line of the commit message only.
    exclude:
      - "^docs:"
      - typo
      - (?i)foo

    # Commit messages matching the regexp listed here will be the only ones
    # added to the changelog
    #
    # If include is not-empty, exclude will be ignored.
    #
    # Matches are performed against the first line of the commit message only.
    include:
      - "^feat:"
