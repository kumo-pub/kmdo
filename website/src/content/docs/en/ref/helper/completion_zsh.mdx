# kmdo pkg completion zsh

Generate the autocompletion script for zsh

## Synopsis

Generate the autocompletion script for the zsh shell.

If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment you will need
to enable it.  You can execute the following once:
```zsh
	echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc
```

To load completions in your current shell session:

```zsh
	source <(kmdo pkg completion zsh)
```

To load completions for every new session, execute once:

### Linux:
```zsh
	kmdo pkg completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_goreleaser"
```
### macOS:
```zsh
	kmdo pkg completion zsh > $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_goreleaser
```
You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.


```
kmdo pkg completion zsh [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help              help for zsh
      --no-descriptions   disable completion descriptions
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --verbose   Enable verbose mode
```
