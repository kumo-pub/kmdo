# Scoop Manifests

After releasing to GitHub, GitLab, or Gitea, Kmdo can generate and publish a
_Scoop App Manifest_ into a repository that you have access to.

The `scoop` section specifies how the manifest should be created. See the
commented example below:

```yaml title=".kmdopkg.yaml"
scoops:
  - # Name of the recipe
    #
    # Default: the project name.
    # Templates: allowed.
    name: myproject

    # URL which is determined by the given Token (github or gitlab)
    #
    # Default:
    #   GitHub: 'https://github.com/<repo_owner>/<repo_name>/releases/download/{{ .Tag }}/{{ .ArtifactName }}'
    #   GitLab: 'https://gitlab.com/<repo_owner>/<repo_name>/-/releases/{{ .Tag }}/downloads/{{ .ArtifactName }}'
    #   Gitea: 'https://gitea.com/<repo_owner>/<repo_name>/releases/download/{{ .Tag }}/{{ .ArtifactName }}'
    # Templates: allowed.
    url_template: "http://github.mycompany.com/foo/bar/releases/{{ .Tag }}/{{ .ArtifactName }}"

    # Directory inside the repository to put the scoop.
    #
    # Note that while scoop works if the manifests are in a directory,
    # 'scoop bucket list' will show 0 manifests if they are not in the root
    # directory.
    # In short, it's generally better to leave this empty.
    directory: Scoops


    # The project name and current git tag are used in the format string.
    #
    # Templates: allowed.
    commit_msg_template: "Scoop update for {{ .ProjectName }} version {{ .Tag }}"

    # Your app's homepage.
    #
    # Templates: allowed.
    # Default: inferred from global metadata.
    homepage: "https://example.com/"

    # Your app's description.
    #
    # Templates: allowed.
    # Default: inferred from global metadata.
    description: "Software to create fast and easy drum rolls."

    # Your app's license
    #
    # Default: inferred from global metadata.
    license: MIT

    # Setting this will prevent kumose to actually try to commit the updated
    # manifest leaving the responsibility of publishing it to the user.
    # If set to auto, the release will not be uploaded to the scoop bucket
    # in case there is an indicator for prerelease in the tag e.g. v1.0.0-rc1
    #
    # Templates: allowed.
    skip_upload: true

    # Persist data between application updates
    persist:

    pre_install: ["Write-Host 'Running preinstall command'"]

    # An array of commands to be executed after an application is installed.

    # An array of dependencies.
    depends: ["git", "foo"]

    # A two-dimensional array of string, specifies the shortcut values to make available in the startmenu.
    # The array has to contain an executable/label pair. The third and fourth element are optional.
    shortcuts: [["drumroll.exe", "drumroll"]]

    # GOAMD64 to specify which amd64 version to use if there are multiple versions
    # from the build section.
    #

By defining the `scoop` section, Kmdo will take care of publishing the
Scoop app. Assuming that the project name is `drumroll`, and the current tag is
`v1.2.3`, the above configuration will generate a `drumroll.json` manifest in
the root of the repository specified in the `bucket` section.

```json
{
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "architecture": {
    "64bit": {
      "url": "https://github.com/user/drumroll/releases/download/1.2.3/drumroll_1.2.3_windows_amd64.tar.gz",
      "bin": "drumroll.exe",
      "hash": "86920b1f04173ee08773136df31305c0dae2c9927248ac259e02aafd92b6008a"
    },
    "32bit": {
      "url": "https://github.com/user/drumroll/releases/download/1.2.3/drumroll_1.2.3_windows_386.tar.gz",
      "bin": "drumroll.exe",
      "hash": "283faa524ef41987e51c8786c61bb56658a489f63512b32139d222b3ee1d18e6"
    }
  },
  "homepage": "https://example.com/"
}
```

Your users can then install your app by doing:

```sh
scoop bucket add org https://github.com/org/repo.git
scoop install org/drumroll
```

You can check the
[Scoop documentation](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop/wiki) for more
details.


## Pull Requests

Kmdo allows you to, instead of pushing directly to the main branch, push
to a feature branch, and open a pull requests with the changes.

### Templates

Kmdo will check for a `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, and set it in
the pull request body if it exists.

We do that to prevent extra work for maintainers of things like `winget-pkgs`,
`nixpkgs`, and so on.

### Cross-repository pull requests

You can also push to a fork, and open the pull request in the original branch.

Here's an example on how to set it up:

```yaml title=".kmdopkg.yaml"
# ...
something: # can be nix, brews, etc...
  - repository:
      owner: john
      name: repo
      branch: "{{.ProjectName}}-{{.Version}}"
      pull_request:
        enabled: true
        base:
          owner: mike
          name: repo
          branch: main
```

This will:

- Try to sync the `john/repo` fork with `mike/repo:main` (if on GitHub).
- Create the files into `john/repo`, in the branch `foo-1.2.3` (assuming
  `ProjectName=foo` and `Version=1.2.3`). [^head]
- Open a pull request from `john/repo` into `mike/repo`, with the branch `main`
  as target. [^base]

[^head]: In GitHub's terms, this means `head=john:repo:foo-1.2.3`

[^base]: In GitHub's terms, this means `base=mike:repo:main`

### Things that don't work

- Opening pull requests to a forked repository (`go-github` does not have the
  required fields to do it).
- Since this can fail for a myriad of reasons, if an error happen, it'll log it
  to the release output, but will not fail the pipeline.
