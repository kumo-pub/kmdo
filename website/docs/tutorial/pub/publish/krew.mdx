# Krew Plugin Manifests

After releasing to GitHub or GitLab, Kmdo can generate and publish a _Krew
Plugin Manifest_ into a repository that you have access to.

Check their [website](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io) for more information.

The `krews` section specifies how the plugins should be created:

```yaml title=".kmdopkg.yaml"
krews:
  -
    # Name of the recipe
    #
    # Default: the project name.
    # Templates: allowed.
    name: myproject

    # IDs of the archives to use.
    ids:
    - foo
    - bar

    # GOARM to specify which 32-bit arm version to use if there are multiple
    # versions from the build section. Krew plugin supports at this moment only
    # one 32-bit version.
    #
    # Default: 6.
    goarm: 6

    # GOAMD64 to specify which amd64 version to use if there are multiple
    # versions from the build section.
    #
    # Default: 'v1'.
    goamd64: v3

    # NOTE: make sure the url_template, the token and given repo (github or
    # gitlab) owner and name are from the same kind. We will probably unify this
    # in the next major version like it is done with scoop.

    # URL which is determined by the given Token (github or
    # gitlab)
    # Default:
    #   GitHub: 'https://github.com/<repo_owner>/<repo_name>/releases/download/{{ .Tag }}/{{ .ArtifactName }}'
    #   GitLab: 'https://gitlab.com/<repo_owner>/<repo_name>/-/releases/{{ .Tag }}/downloads/{{ .ArtifactName }}'
    #   Gitea: 'https://gitea.com/<repo_owner>/<repo_name>/releases/download/{{ .Tag }}/{{ .ArtifactName }}'
    # Templates: allowed.
    url_template: "http://github.mycompany.com/foo/bar/releases/{{ .Tag }}/{{ .ArtifactName }}"

    # The project name and current git tag are used in the format string.
    commit_msg_template: "Krew plugin update for {{ .ProjectName }} version {{ .Tag }}"

    # Your app's homepage.
    #
    # Default: inferred from global metadata.
    homepage: "https://example.com/"

    # Your app's description.
    # The usual guideline for this is to wrap the line at 80 chars.
    #
    # Templates: allowed.
    # Default: inferred from global metadata.
    description: "Software to create fast and easy drum rolls."

    # Your app's short description.
    # The usual guideline for this is to be at most 50 chars long.
    #
    # Templates: allowed.
    # Default: inferred from global metadata.
    short_description: "Software to create fast and easy drum rolls."

    # Caveats for the user of your binary.
    # The usual guideline for this is to wrap the line at 80 chars.
    caveats: "How to use this binary"

    # Setting this will prevent kmdo to actually try to commit the updated
    # krew plugin - instead, the plugin file will be stored on the dist directory
    # only, leaving the responsibility of publishing it to the user.
    # If set to auto, the release will not be uploaded to the Krew plugin
    # in case there is an indicator for prerelease in the tag e.g. v1.0.0-rc1
    skip_upload: true

    # Repository to push the generated files to.
    repository:
      # Repository owner.

      # provided to Kmdo

## Limitations

- Only one binary per archive is allowed;
- Binary releases (when `archives.format` is set to `binary`) are not allowed;
- Only one `GOARM` build is allowed;


## Pull Requests

Kmdo allows you to, instead of pushing directly to the main branch, push
to a feature branch, and open a pull requests with the changes.

### Templates

Kmdo will check for a `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, and set it in
the pull request body if it exists.

We do that to prevent extra work for maintainers of things like `winget-pkgs`,
`nixpkgs`, and so on.

### Cross-repository pull requests

You can also push to a fork, and open the pull request in the original branch.

Here's an example on how to set it up:

```yaml title=".kmdopkg.yaml"
# ...
something: # can be nix, brews, etc...
  - repository:
      owner: john
      name: repo
      branch: "{{.ProjectName}}-{{.Version}}"
      pull_request:
        enabled: true
        base:
          owner: mike
          name: repo
          branch: main
```

This will:

- Try to sync the `john/repo` fork with `mike/repo:main` (if on GitHub).
- Create the files into `john/repo`, in the branch `foo-1.2.3` (assuming
  `ProjectName=foo` and `Version=1.2.3`). [^head]
- Open a pull request from `john/repo` into `mike/repo`, with the branch `main`
  as target. [^base]

[^head]: In GitHub's terms, this means `head=john:repo:foo-1.2.3`

[^base]: In GitHub's terms, this means `base=mike:repo:main`

### Things that don't work

- Opening pull requests to a forked repository (`go-github` does not have the
  required fields to do it).
- Since this can fail for a myriad of reasons, if an error happen, it'll log it
  to the release output, but will not fail the pipeline.
