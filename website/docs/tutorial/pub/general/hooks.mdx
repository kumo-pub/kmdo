# Global Hooks

Some release cycles may need to run something before or after everything else.

Kmdo allows this with the global hooks feature.


    The `before` section allows for global hooks that will be executed
    **before** the release is started.

    The configuration is straightforward, here is an example will all possible
    options:

    ```yaml title=".kmdopkg.yaml"
    before:
      # Templates for the commands to be ran.
      hooks:
      - make clean
      - go generate ./...
      - go mod tidy
      - touch {{ .Env.FILE_TO_TOUCH }}
    ```


Note that if any of the hooks fails the release process is aborted.

## Complex commands

If you need to do anything more complex, it is recommended to create a shell
script and call it instead. You can also go crazy with `sh -c "my commands"`,
but it gets ugly really fast.
