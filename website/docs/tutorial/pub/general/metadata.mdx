# Metadata

Kmdo creates some metadata files in the `dist` directory before it
finishes running.

You can also set some global defaults that can be used by other features.

```yaml title=".kmdopkg.yaml"
metadata:
  # Set the modified timestamp on the metadata files.
  #
  # Templates: allowed.
  mod_timestamp: "{{ .CommitTimestamp }}"

```
