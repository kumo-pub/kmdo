# Setting a custom git tag

You can override the current and previous tags by setting some environment
variables. This can be useful in cases where one git commit is referenced by
multiple git tags, for example.

Example usage:

```sh
export KMDO_CURRENT_TAG=v1.2.3
export KMDO_PREVIOUS_TAG=v1.1.0
kmdo pub release
```
